## Python Exploratory data analysis
***
### About the Repository 

+ Aimed to analyze raw data sets from Kaggle, especially through data visualization with Python.
+ The goal was to utilize data analysis tools from libraries to gain data insights.
+ Started the project on 01MAY24.

### Development Environment

+ Python

### Features and Explanation
#### Pandas_test.ipynb

+ Tested out basic features of Python libraries (e.g. histogram, scatter plot, decision tree, etc.).
+ Used the built-in Iris flower dataset.

#### used_car.ipynb

+ Drew scatterplots using different variables such as mileage, price, and model year.
+ Processed data by removing outliers.
+ Through data visualization, showed negative and positive correlations between different variables.
+ Used the used car dataset from Kaggle.

#### credit_card.ipynb

+ Drew histograms to roughly illustrate the distributions of variables.
+ Drew bar graphs to compare the number of approvals/approval rates between gender, age, and property status.
+ Drew a decision tree using approval status to classify and predict variables.
+ Used the credit card dataset from Kaggle.

#### mushroom.ipynb

+ Classified data in terms of mushrooms' edibility.
+ Drew scatterplots with different dot sizes depending on the count/percentage of variables.
+ Used the mushroom dataset from Kaggle.

#### fifa.ipynb

+ Made a program that draws a overlapping radar chart when
+ Drew pie charts/histograms to compare players' preferred foot, position, age, and overall.
+ Drew boxplots to show the height, age, overall, and wage difference between positions.
+ Drew scatterplots to check correlations between overall and wage.
+ Reduced the mean squared error of the prediction model by modifying data/variables and calculated the regression line equation.
+ Split range into 100 sub-ranges and randomly selected samples from each range with the same size for even representation, and drew scatterplots comparing real wages to the predicted wages.
+ Used the FIFA23 dataset from Kaggle.
